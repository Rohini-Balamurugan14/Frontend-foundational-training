        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I am a B.E. Electronics & Communication Engineering (ECE) graduate from XYZ University, graduating in 2024 with a CGPA of 8.88/10. During my time at university, I focused on building a strong foundation in programming, data structures, computer networks, and database management, all of which I applied in real-world projects like a Task Manager API built with Java and Spring Boot. Prior to that, I completed my 12th in CBSE (PCMB) with 87% in 2020, where I developed a deep interest in analytical problem-solving and technical subjects. I also completed my 10th in CBSE with 91% in 2018, excelling in subjects like Mathematics and Science, which sparked my passion for engineering and technology.</p>
