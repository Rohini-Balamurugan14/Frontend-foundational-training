    <h2>Reading fanfiction</h2>
    <p>Reading fanfiction is a fun and creative way to engage with beloved characters and universes from books, TV shows, movies, or games. Fans write their own stories, often expanding on existing plots or exploring alternate scenarios. <mark>It allows for a deeper connection with fictional worlds, as readers experience new perspectives, character arcs, and "what if" situations</mark>. Fanfiction communities are welcoming, where fans can share their work, receive feedback, and bond over mutual interests. For many, itâ€™s a way to express creativity, explore new writing styles, and enjoy stories that may not exist in the official canon.</p>
